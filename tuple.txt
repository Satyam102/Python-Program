In python tuples are immutable. So it cannot be change or it cannot be delete.
()	#empty tuple, tuple with no member.
(1,2,3)  #tuple of integer.
(1,2.2,3.32)  #tuple of number(integers and floating point).
('a','b','c')	#tuple of characters.
('a',1,'as',23)  #tuple of mixed value types.
('one','two','three')	#tuple of sstrings.

t = (1,)
print(t)

Long tuple:
lt = (12,21,2,3,213,12,312,31,23,1,3,1,31)


Nested tuple:
agar tuple ke andar tuple ho to use nested tuple khate hai.
ex: (12,21,(12,1))

T = tuple(<sequence>)


Joining tuples:
hum + operator ki madad se tuples ko join kar sakte hai.
